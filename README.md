### Overview

**Intro**

This project was a new and somewhat different learning experience. We started learning JavaScript. It's purpose was to practice, improve and perfect my new skills, as well as the "old" ones, which i'm starting to get used to.
In this Project the emphasis was on:
* Reinforcing my skills, working with layouts.
* Mastering the basics of JavaScript.
* Manipulating HTML and CSS through JavaScript.
* Fixing bugs and errors in my JavaScript code.
I've learned a lot of new things, practiced my already somewhat purchased skills and mostly - improved my self-studying skills.
